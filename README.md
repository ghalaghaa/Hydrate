# Hydrate

The "Hydrate" app, developed using the Swift programming language, is an innovative tool designed to help users track their daily water intake. The app aims to assist users in staying hydrated by providing an easy way to log and monitor their water consumption based on their individual needs.

Key Features of the App:

Personal Weight Input: Users can input their body weight to customize the optimal daily water intake target.

Notification Preferences: The app allows users to set custom start and end times for notifications and choose the intervals between reminders (e.g., every 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or up to 5 hours) for consistent tracking.

Simple and Clear User Interface: The app features a user-friendly interface with playful illustrations that change as the user logs their water intake, including icons like a sleeping symbol, a turtle, and a rabbit.

Accurate Daily Tracking: The app includes a visual display that shows the consumed and target water amounts through unique circular graphs, helping users monitor their progress.

Progress Interaction: Once the user reaches their required water intake, a congratulatory icon is displayed to motivate them to achieve their goals.

Technologies Used:

The app was developed using Swift.

The user interface was built with SwiftUI to ensure a smooth and attractive design.

Local notifications were implemented using the UserNotifications framework to deliver precise and customized alerts.

This project is designed to raise awareness about the importance of daily hydration and encourage users to take care of their health through innovative and user-friendly technology.
